# DocumentationAppProject
Documentation app for uploading and downloading documents from the database.

This app is my smaller "fun project" just for the purpose of exercising. 
This app uses express-session with express-mysql-session to store sessions as logs in database. 
The documents are uploaded using multer and are downloaded using URL.createObjectURL().
